        <h3>African Wild Ass</h3>
        <h4><em>Equus africanus somaliensis</em></h4>
        <p>The African Wild Ass (or African Wild Donkey) is a wild member of the horse family, <em>Equidae</em>. This species is believed to be the ancestor of the domestic donkey, which is usually placed within the same species. They live in the deserts and other arid areas of the Horn of Africa, in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. It formerly had a wider range north and west into Sudan, Egypt, and Libya. About 570 individuals exist in the wild.</p>

        <h3>Ocelot</h3>
        <h4><em>Leopardus pardalis</em></h4>
        <p>The Ocelot also known as the dwarf leopard, is a wild cat distributed extensively within South America including the islands of Trinidad and Margarita, Central America, and Mexico. It has been reported as far north as Texas. North of Mexico, it is found regularly only in the extreme southern part of Texas, although there are rare sightings in southern Arizona.</p>

        <h3>Steller Sea Lion</h3>
        <h4><em>Eumetopias jubatus</em></h4>
        <p>Also known as the northern sea lion and Steller's sea lion, is a near threatened species of sea lions in the northern Pacific. It is the sole member of the genus Eumetopias and the largest of the eared seals (Otariidae). Among pinnipeds, it is inferior in size only to the walrus and the two elephant seals. The Steller sea lion has attracted considerable attention in recent decades due to significant, unexplained declines in their numbers over a large portion of their range in Alaska.</p>

        <h3>Giant Panda</h3>
        <h4><em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em></h4>
        <p>The Giant Panda, also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in neighbouring provinces, namely Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.</p>

        <img class="animal" src="img/tiger.jpg" alt="tiger" />
        <h3>Tiger</h3>
        <h4><em>Panthera tigris</em></h4>
        <p>The tiger is the largest cat species, most recognisable for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.</p>

        <img class="animal" src="img/emperor-penguin.jpg" alt="Emperor Penguin" />
        <h3>Emperor Penguin</h3>
        <h4><em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em></h4>
        <p>The Emperor Penguin is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica. The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching 122 cm (48 in) in height and weighing from 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). The dorsal side and head are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches. Like all penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat.</p>

      <div class="gray-wolf">
        <img class="animal" src="img/gray-wolf.jpg" alt="Gray Wolf" />
        <h3>Gray Wolf</h3>
        <h4><em>Canis lupus</em></h4>
        <p>The Gray Wolf is the second most specialised member of the genus Canis, after the Ethiopian wolf, as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature, and its highly advanced expressive behavior. It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as the eastern wolf, coyote, and golden jackal to produce fertile hybrids. It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds, and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean. It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring. The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.</p>

        <h3>European Bison</h3>
        <h4><em>Bison bonasus</em></h4>
        <p>The European Bison, also known as wisent or the European Wood Bison, is a Eurasian species of bison. It is one of two extant species of bison, alongside the American bison. Three subspecies have existed in the past, but only one survives today. European bison were hunted to extinction in the wild in the early 20th century. They have since been reintroduced from captivity into several countries in Europe, all descendants of the Białowieża or lowland European bison.</p>

        <img class="animal" src="img/chimpanzee.jpg" alt="Chimpanzee" />
        <h3>Chimpanzee</h3>
        <h4><em>Pan troglodytes</em></h4>
        <p>Chimpanzees are one of two exclusively African species of great ape that are currently extant. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, both are currently found in the Congo jungle. Classified in the genus Pan, they were once considered to be one species. However, since 1928, they have been recognized as two distinct species: the common chimpanzee (<em>P. troglodytes</em>) live north of the Congo River and the bonobo (<em>P. paniscus</em>) who live south. In addition, P. troglodytes is divided into four subspecies, while P. paniscus has none. Based on genome sequencing, the two extant Pan species diverged around one million years ago. The most obvious differences are that chimpanzees are somewhat larger, more aggressive and male dominated, while the bonobos are more gracile, peaceful, and female dominated.</p>

        <img class="animal" src="img/manatee.jpg" alt="West Indian Manatee" />
        <h3>West Indian Manatee</h3>
        <h4><em>Trichechus manatus</em></h4>
        <p>The West Indian Manatee or "sea cow" is a manatee, and the largest surviving member of the aquatic mammal order Sirenia (which also includes the dugong and the extinct Steller's Sea Cow). The West Indian Manatee is a species distinct from the Amazonian manatee (<em>T. inunguis</em>) and the African manatee (<em>T. senegalensis</em>). Based on genetic and morphological studies, the West Indian manatee is divided into two subspecies, the Florida manatee (<em>T. m. latirostris</em>) and the Antillean or Caribbean manatee (T. m. manatus). However, recent genetic (mtDNA) research suggests that the West Indian Manatee actually consists of three groups, which are more or less geographically distributed as:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Florida and the Greater Antilles</li>
          <li>Mexico, Central America and northern South America</li>
          <li>northeastern South America</li>
        </ol>

      <div class="potoroo">
        <img class="animal" src="img/potoroo.jpg" alt="Gilbert's Potoroo" />
        <h3>Gilbert's Potoroo</h3>
        <h4><em>Potorous gilbertii</em></h4>
        <p>Gilbert's Potoroo, sometimes called the "rat-kangaroo" or "garlgyte", is Australia's most endangered marsupial and one of the world's most endangered mammals. It is a small nocturnal marsupial which lives in small groups or colonies. It has long hind feet and front feet with curved claws which it uses for digging food. Its body has large amounts of fur which helps with insulation, and its fur ranges between brown and grey; the color fading on its belly. This potoroo has a long, thin snout curving downward that it uses to smell its surroundings; this trait is common in all potoroo species. Its eyes appear to bulge out of its face and look as though they are on an angle and its ears are almost invisible, buried under thick fur. Male and female body types are very similar and are both within the same size range. Adult females range in weight from 708–1205 g (including pouch young where present), whereas adult males range in weight from 845–1200 g. The current estimated population is a sparse seventy individuals. It was thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1994. The only population is found in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve in Western Australia, where they co-exist with quokkas.</p>

        <h3>Blue Whale</h3>
        <h4><em>Balaenoptera musculus</em></h4>
        <p>The Blue Whale is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whales (<em>Mysticeti</em>). At up to 30 metres (98 ft) in length and with a maximum recorded weight of 173 tonnes (191 short tons), it is the largest extant animal and is the heaviest known to have existed.</p>
